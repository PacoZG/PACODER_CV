You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### For styling
I used [`tailwind v2`](https://v2.tailwindcss.com/) for most of the components but for few others, due to the limitations of tailwind package or complexity of the task I used raw `CSS`

### For formatting
In the case of formatting I turned to `Prettier`, I set the format rules inside the `.prettierrc.json` and by running the `npm run prettier` script one can fix the code's format.

### For routing
For endpoint routing [React router](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) has been my dependency of choice since I started my developer journey.

### For translations
I used [i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) framework, I also used it when I was working on the [project](https://github.com/PacoZG/janestotalwellness) as part of fullstack studies, powerful, quite straight forward and there is a lot of documentation and tutorials, try it out!.

### For social media icons
[react-share](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-share) was my tool of choice.
